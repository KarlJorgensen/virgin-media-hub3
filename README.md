virgin-media-hub3
=================

This is a python API and command line interface for the Virgin Media
Hub 3 broadband router.

This allows you to view/change the configuration of the router through
a decent API or through the command line.

Unlike the (rather mediocre) web interface, this allows you to
view/change settings that are not necessarily exposed through the web
interface. For example, you can add port forwardings for ports that
the web interface will not allow (e.g. port 53 if you want to run a
local DNS server).

The Virgin Media Hub 3 is a customised version of the Arris TG2492
router:
